## Annotated Data:
To provide multi-modal data for enhancing autonomous off-road navigation, we developed an ontology of object and terrain classes that extends the foundation of the [RELLIS-3D dataset](https://github.com/unmannedlab/RELLIS-3D), while incorporating additional terrain and object categories specific to our dataset. Notably, our sequences introduce new classes such as gravel and mulch, which were absent in RELLIS-3D. Overall, the dataset encompasses 22 distinct classes, including **trees, grass, dirt, sky, gravel, bush, mulch, water, poles, fences, persons, buildings, objects, vehicles, barriers, mud, concrete, puddles, rubble, asphalt, and a void class**. This expanded ontology provides a more comprehensive understanding of off-road environments, offering enriched data for advanced semantic segmentation and improved performance in challenging, unstructured terrains.
